## Express.js Starter Template

 Every time I start a new express.js project I clone an existing project and clean the unwanted code in it. Also, I use the same archeticture in most of my projects which is the arch. of this repository; So, I decided to create this repository to be the starter point for me by containing the dependancies, project archeticture and reusable code that exists in most of my projects.
